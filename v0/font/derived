# Any line that starts with # is a comment .
# All clusters are lower case and must apear in the correct order (e.g. 'oe' is a syntax error).
#
# Pipes seperate the cluster name from it's derivation.
# A clusters derivation is a list of existing clusters that can be combined to form the new cluster.
# Cluster names are space seperated.
#
# Clusters can include the following modifiers after a `.` to indicate transformations
# - d: Bump the cluster down (the magnitude of the bump depends on the group the cluster belongs to).
#      For example vowels will be bumped down from the top vowel line to the bottom vowel line.
#      Consonants on the other hand will be bumped from hangin off the top consonant line to standing on the bottom consonant line
#      If the stroke is already on the bottom of the character this is an error
# - u: The inverse of d
# - r: The same as D/U but for moving strokes to the right.
#      For vowels the behavior moves the stroke from the left vowel line to the right vowel line.
#      For Consonants this moves the stroke from the initial consonant slot to the final consonant slot.
# - l: The inverse of r
# - x: Mirrior the stroke along the x axis.
# - x: Mirrior the stroke along the y axis.
#
# Just because a stroke has a derived definition does not mean the stroke need be derived.
# If an explicit definition for the stroke is provided in the template SVG file, that will used instead.

# VOWELS 
# standard order for vowels is A, O, E, U
